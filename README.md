This is a frontend application for the node-spotify module for node.js
It was extracted mainly because I want to have a demo branch for the project website http://www.node-spotify.com.

It is written in angular.js and uses jQuery for some DOM manipulation. The communication with the backend is done via websockets (socket.io).
